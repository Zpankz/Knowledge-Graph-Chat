# Literary Knowledge Graph RAG

A sophisticated system that builds narrative-aware knowledge graphs from literary texts and enables natural language querying using Graph RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with Chain of Thought reasoning.

## Theory & Background

This system implements several key concepts:

- **Graph-based RAG**: Extends traditional RAG by structuring information in a knowledge graph, preserving relationships and context
- **Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning**: Uses guided walks through the graph to build coherent narrative understanding
- **Community Detection**: Identifies thematically related subgraphs to improve retrieval relevance
- **Narrative Coherence**: Maintains story flow and context through specialized graph traversal

## Core Features
